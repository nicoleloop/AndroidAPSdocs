# List of Tested Phones for use with Omnipod Dash Pods

Currently, we have one maintainer in charge of ensuring the integrity of the list for the phones which are successfully able to be used to run AAPS with Omnipod Dash Insulin Pump Pods. Dash is the most recent pump driver addition to our ever-expanding network of integrated insulin pumps (with Bluetooth capabilities) within the AndroidAPS/OpenAPS Project! 

Since the work involved in adapting new pump drivers can be a long process, there is usually a need for closer communication between those testing out the new pump drivers, known as Early Adaptors, and the those in charge of working towards the solutions for successful integration. This is where Excel Spreadsheets can come in handy! They are a simple way to pool information from many different users; iespecially the information used in comparing and contrasting the "Most successful vs. Incompatible vs. Somewhat compatible" Android Phones available currently which have the ability to communicate (via Bluetooth) with the Omnipod Dash pods. This was also created with new users in mind, who might still be unsure of which insulin pump would be the best option for them and can, by perusing this Sheet, will hopefully be able to purchase the right equipment the first time!

If in the future the need for another hardware list arises again  and someone wants to take care of this list, please contact us!

The current maintainer of the list has spent a lot of time and effort to make it easy to enter data, but also to make sure that existing data cannot be accidentally overwritten or deleted. This experience can be built upon again with Google Sheets.

The list of the tested phone can be accessed via the following link [list of tested phones with Omnipod insulin pump](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zO-Vf3wv0jji5Gflk6pe48oi348ApF5RvMcI6NG5TnY)

With CRTL-F you can search in the text of the Google sheet. The sheet is write protected. To record your test of a phone please fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/g7GbSkMCTfFrWKjSA).

After you fill in the form data the maintainer will check the data and approve it for publishing!

Any problems with the spreadsheet please contact us directly or via a GitHub issue for the openaps/AndroidAPSDocs project.
